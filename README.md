Provider Eligibility Assessment

  * PNDS data is matched against information on professional licensing, Office of Professional Medical Care sanctions, 
    and Medicaid and Medicare provider eligibility, to assure that only qualified providers are delivering health care to 
    plan members. Facilities are checked for valid operating certificate numbers and that operating certificate numbers match 
    the type of facility indicated.
